                            <p>The journey of UNMESH began in 2003, born from the visionary ideals of Mr.
                                AKM Ashraf ul Alam, a
                                former UNICEF officer. His pioneering concept focused on transforming
                                developing countries such as
                                Bangladesh and Tanzania into sustainable societies by leveraging their
                                natural assets—wind, water,
                                solar energy, soil, and above all, people.</p>
                            <p> Mr. Alam’s approach was ahead of its time, emerging during the early
                                discourse around the three
                                pillars of sustainability: environmental protection, social equity, and
                                economic viability. His
                                ambition was to create holistic solutions that not only addressed
                                environmental challenges but
                                also empowered communities and stimulated economic growth.</p>
